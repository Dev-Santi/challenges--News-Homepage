## About this proyect

It is a challenge proyect supplied by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/SantiNakc">Frontend Mentor</a>

## What did I do?

- I used pure CSS and vanilla JS
- I tried to make it the fastest and cleanest i can
- I made it responsive, like every page or web aplication i make

It was in general an easy layout to practice grid, but it was a challenge to make the mobile-nav work as expected.
