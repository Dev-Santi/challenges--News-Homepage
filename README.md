## About this proyect

A responsive landing page using Flex and Grid, and a little bit of JS.<br>
It is a challenge proyect supplied by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/SantiNakc">Frontend Mentor</a>


## How I made it

- I used pure CSS and vanilla JS
- I made a container to make the filter work when the nav is active
- I disable scroll when the nav is active
- I made it responsive

It was in general an easy layout to practice grid, but it was a bit challenge to make the mobile-nav work as expected.
